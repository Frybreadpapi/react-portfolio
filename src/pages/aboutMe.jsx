            <p> Hello I just want to start off by giving a brief description of myself. My name is Jon Hall, I am from the Crow Creek reservation located in South Dakota. I currently reside in Lawrence, Kansas.  I am an ex college basketball player who still spends most of his free time in the gym and weight room. Reading, video games, and chilling with my friends/family also take up most of my free time. </p>
